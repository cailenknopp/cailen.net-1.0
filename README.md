# cailen.net
cailen.net is my main website for hosting stuff. I mainly use this website for hosting Codiad (an awesome cloud coding IDE framework), however I do have a website theme that I use for an information page and for a homepage. The style for this website is heavly influnced by old 1980's dial up websites, blended with a linux terminal window.
